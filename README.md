This repository contains some scripts to retrieve data from The DAO on the Ethereum blockchain.

The script `getTheDAOCreatedTokenEvents` can be used to retrieve The DAO CreatedToken events. The complete data extracted by this script can be found in `CreatedTokenEvents.txt`.

The script `getTheDAOTransferEvents` can be used to retrieve The DAO Transfer events. The incomplete data extracted by this script can be found in `TransferEvents.txt`. This is because The DAO transfers are still occurring.
